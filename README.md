# Installation
To Install this repositories run below commond from your terminal

`git clone https://github.com/ashurai/cimpSymfonyRepoListing.git`

After having repository on your local system run Install the symfony with all dependencies using below command:

`composer install `

Note:- Before running this command make inside a "var" directory is available else create a "var" directory inside application root structure because I don't want to make hectic to you with too many cache files commiting or downloading, this is specially required in case you are running on Ubuntu machine.

Inside twig file added a commented dump section which could help to find more fields if you want to list extra parameters from github APi's.
